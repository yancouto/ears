# ears [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nickbrowne/ears.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nickbrowne/ears) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/0dhp10u9y2ivrieo/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nickbrowne/ears/branch/master) [![](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/ears)](https://crates.io/crates/ears)

Ears aims to be a convenient and easy to understand Rust interface over OpenAL.

It's designed first and foremost for game development, giving you easy access to
complex functionality like HRTF, spatialization, and environmental effects with
almost no configuration required.

**[View documentation](https://docs.rs/ears/)**

Supports a wide variety of audio formats, including:

* Ogg Vorbis
* Microsoft WAV
* RAW PCM
* Lossless FLAC
* AIFF

For a full list please see the documentation for libsndfile here: http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

## Before you start

You need to install OpenAL and libsndfile on your system.

#### Linux (Debian and Ubuntu):

```
sudo apt install libopenal-dev libsndfile1-dev
```

#### Linux (Fedora):

```
sudo dnf install openal-soft-devel libsndfile-devel
```

#### Mac:

```
brew install openal-soft libsndfile
```

#### Windows:

The easiest way to get up and running is using the GNU toolchain. So first
check which toolchain is currently active:

```
rustup show
```

If the GNU toolchain is not active, you can either set it as the system wide
default:

```
rustup default stable-gnu
```

Or set it per directory:

```
rustup override set stable-gnu
```

Then install [MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/) according to the instructions. Be sure to
use the default installation folder (i.e. `C:\msys32` or `C:\msys64`), as currently
ears is hard coded to link against libraries in that location.

Then, run the following in the MSYS2 shell:

```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libsndfile mingw-w64-x86_64-openal
```

## Usage

Include `ears` in your `Cargo.toml` dependencies.

```toml
[dependencies]
ears = "0.8.0"
```

Playing a sound effect while simultaneously streaming music off disk is as simple as it gets.

```rust
extern crate ears;
use ears::{Music, Sound, AudioController};

fn main() {
    let mut music = Music::new("your-music.ogg").unwrap();
    music.play();

    let mut sound = Sound::new("your-sound-effect.wav").unwrap();
    sound.play();

    while music.is_playing() || sound.is_playing() {};
}
```

## Running examples

```
cargo run --example basic
cargo run --example advanced
cargo run --example music
cargo run --example record
cargo run --example simple_player
cargo run --example threads
cargo run --example direct_channel
```
